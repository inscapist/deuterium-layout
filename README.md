## Benefits
- Very high efficiency due to very low SFBS, SFS (and redirect SFS). You would feel that all fingers are equally utilized
- `y` can be typed with either hand, depending on letter sequence. And this eliminates a lot of efficiency problems
- Sufficient alternation between hands and between fingers (**it is quite hard to achieve this**)
- Having many letters on the homerow
- High inrolls/outrolls ratio (outrolls can feel less natural if they are on the pinky/ring)
- Having hjkl on the same hand in a relatively natural positions (vim + tiling window managers)

## Design choices (some of it can be controversial)

#### Pushes frequent letters to the outer ring/pinky
This allows the index fingers to move inward reach inner column letters such as `y`, `p` and `x` more easily. In technical term, this reduces overall Lateral Stretch Bigrams (LSBs)

#### `E` being on the pinky position
I have `e` on pinky finger for almost a year, it is not really a problem. It may be a problem if `e` were to be on the right hand, as the right pinky has the additional burden of hitting BACKSPACE, ENTER, and punctuations.

#### Having H at the qwerty `n` position
H is somewhat frequent in common english, but there are several reasons I placed it there :
- it eliminates 2u (2 rows) jump on the index fingers
- it allows `why` to be typed in this sequence: Left index -> right index -> right index
- it prevents index finger from being curled up in the `k` (qwerty `m`) position, which makes `y`/`x` harder to reach

#### Right pinky having extra letters `z` and `v`
The `v` position may a dealbreaker for some, but they are not unreasonable because `v` is usually a skipgram with another consonants (exceptions being `r`, `n`, `l`). And most of the letters that interact heavily with `v` are assigned to index finger, so there's sufficient runway. `z` is in the most awkward position but it is the least frequent letter in english.
