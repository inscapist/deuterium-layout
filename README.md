# Psych (Previously Kenshin 剣心)

[link (select "angle mod")](https://cyanophage.github.io/playground.html?lan=english&layout=%2Fuofkjbmlp-eias%27chtrn.%2C%3Bvyzgdwxq%5C%5E&mode=iso)

## Design choices
- Prefer sfbs on index fingers
- Prefer low sfs over sfbs because the latter can be alted more easily
- Having hjkl in natural positions 

## Features
- [angle modded](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html) for row staggered (aka standard) keyboards
- same hand h/j/k/l (k is technically on the right hand, but next to j)
- sfbs are very alt-fingerable
- low SFS (4.74% vs kuntem 4.87% on shai)
- high rolls, especially inrolls

# Looking for kenshin?

Kenshin is my first published layout, when I was still chasing stats (sfbs, sfs). But it is quite imbalanced in that the vowel hand has too much responsibility. ("because" is almost typed in the same hand, and "goes", just to illustrate)
