# Kenshin (standard)

# Features
- preserves qwerty c/v/g positions
- makes use of pinky e
- sfbs can be alted for:
  - gs (0.06%)
  - ph (0.058%)
  - dy (0.048%)
  - ws (0.04%)
  - py+yp (0.03%)

## Tips
- it is very natural to alt when `s` is at the end of the sequence
- `sc` is more difficult to alt due to sc[ao] taking up 0.05%(half of the SFBs). So it would be a sliding motion in practice, even though its possible to alt in my own experience
