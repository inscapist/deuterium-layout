# Features
- preserves qwerty c
- low sfs
- sfbs can be alted for:
  - ys (0.103%) 
  - gs (0.06%)
  - ph (0.058%)
  - sy (0.043%) 
  - ws (0.04%)
  - py+yp (0.03%)
  - cy (0.03%)


## Tips
- it is very natural to alt when `s` is at the end of the sequence
- `sc` is more difficult to alt due to sc[ao] taking up 0.05%(half of the SFBs). So it would be a sliding motion in practice, even though its possible to alt in my own experience
- for `sy`, it's trainable to alt when it is at the beginning (eg. system). But when it's in the middle (eg, `async`), it may be difficult (but it's really not too bad)
